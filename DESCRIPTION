Description: We developed the clues R package to provide functions 
        for automatically estimating the number of clusters and 
        getting the final cluster partition without any input 
        parameter except the stopping rule for convergence. 
        The package also provides functions to
        evaluate and compare the performances of partitions of a data
        set both numerically and graphically.
